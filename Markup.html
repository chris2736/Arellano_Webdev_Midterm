    "When they ask how you love the rain, the ocean, the river,
    <br>
    tell them, it is because unlike the people
    <br>
    who should have loved you better,
    <br>
   <strong> the water was never afraid to touch you
    <br>
     even when you were at your most damaged and broken." </strong>
